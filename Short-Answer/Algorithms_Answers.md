#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) because you are running the code if a < n^3, and you are changing a to be n^2 so the next iteration will be the last


b)O(n^2) because there are nested for loops


c)O(n) this is a recursive code that will run n times

## Exercise II

a Binary search of O(log n) would reduce the number of eggs broken. First you find the middle floor and drop it, if it breaks you move down to the middle floor, if it does not break you move up to the middle, you repeat this until you find f
